## Hi ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Sidney Sussex College and the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, the University of Cambridge, under Prof Roberto Maiolino and Dr Sandro Tacchella.
- ðŸŒ  My research interests revolve around galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe: how the first stars and galaxies were formed, and how they subsequently brought about the Reionisation of the Universe.
